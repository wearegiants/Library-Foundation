== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

It stores the user details every time a post is viewed, the totals are incremented so it will show the posts with the most hits in the widget.

= Why are no posts displaying when I use the widget? =

99% of the time this is because no posts have been visited yet. Simply click on a blog post to read it on your blog and it will display in the list of most popular posts.

= How does Popularity Posts Widget select my posts thumbnails? =

First of all plugin will try and use the Featured Image you have selected for each of your posts and use it to create a thumbnail. If none is set, Popularity Posts Widget will search for fist image of each post to create thumbnails. If there is no images in youre post, then "no_photo" image will be used instead.

Yes, please do so on the WordPress support forum for the plugin. I will consider it and if I feel it is worth adding, I will schedule it for a future release.

= How can I use shortcode or template tag? =

You can use shortcode [ppw] for showing most popular posts in youre pages or posts. It can be used with some options, that you can see below, or without them (in this case will be used defaults ones).

*Usage:*

`[ppw]`

`[ppw range=all stats_views=1]`

If you can't or don't want to use widget - *ppw_get_popular_posts()* template tag is for you. Like and shortcode, it can be use with options or without them.

*Usage:*

Without any parameters:

`<?php if (function_exists('ppw_get_popular_posts')) ppw_get_popular_posts(); ?>`

Using parameters:

`<?php if (function_exists('ppw_get_popular_posts')) ppw_get_popular_posts("range=all&stats_views=1"); ?>`
