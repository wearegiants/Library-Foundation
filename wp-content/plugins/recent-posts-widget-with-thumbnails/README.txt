Small and fast plugin to display in the sidebar a list of linked titles and thumbnails of the most recent postings

== Description ==

No huge widget with hundreds of options. This plugin is based on the well-known WordPress default widget 'Recent Posts' and enhanced to display thumbnails of the posts.

The thumbnails will be built from the featured image of a post or of the first image in the post content. If there is neither a featured image nor a content image then you can define a default thumbnail.

The thumbnails appears left-aligned to the post titles. You can set the width and heigth of the thumbnails in the list.

The widget is available in english and german.

2. Number of listed posts
3. Hide current post in list
4. Keep sticky posts on top of the list
5. Hide post title
6. Show post date

8. Excerpt length
9. Signs after excerpt
10. Show post of selected categories (or of all categories)
11. Show post thumbnail (featured image)
12. Registered thumbnail dimensions
13. Thumbnail width in px
14. Thumbnail height in px
15. Keep aspect ratio of thumbnails
16. Try to take the first post image as thumbnail
17. Only use the first post image as thumbnail
18. Use default thumbnail if no thumbnail is available

= Useful hints for developers: Hooks and CSS =

See [Other Notes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/recent-posts-widget-with-thumbnails/other_notes/) for supported hooks and available CSS selectors.

= Supported Hooks =

The plugin considers the output of actions hooked on:

= Available CSS Selectors =

To design the list and its items you can use these CSS selectors:

All list items in the list:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li`

All list items of sticky posts in the list:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li.rpwwt-sticky`

All links in the list; every link contains the image and the post title:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a`

All images in the list (use that to set the margins around images):
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a img`

All post titles in the list:
`.rpwwt-widget ul li a span.rpwwt-post-title`

All post dates in the list:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

The WordPress version should be at least 2.9 to use featured images.

The theme should support `wp_head()` in the HTML header section to print the CSS code for a beautiful alignment of the thumbnails.

= Can I set a default thumbnail? =

Yes.

= Can I set the width and height of the thumbnail? =

Yes. You can enter the desired width and height of the thumbnails or select one of the sizes as set in 'Settings' > 'Media'.

= Can I change the alignment of the thumbnails in the list? =

This feature will come in a future version of the plugin. Set the alignment in the CSS of your theme instead.

= Where can I set the CSS of the list? =

This feature will come in a future version of the plugin. Set the CSS in the style.css of your theme instead.

= Can the plugin take the first image of a post as thumbnail image? =

Yes. It works with images previously uploaded into the media library. You can select to prefer the first image to the featured image or to use the first image only.

= Which languages does the plugin support? =

Actually these languages are supported:

* English
* German

Further translations are welcome. If you want to give in your translation please leave a notice in the [plugin's support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/recent-posts-widget-with-thumbnails).

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

If you want to contribute a translation of the plugin in your language it would be great! You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.
