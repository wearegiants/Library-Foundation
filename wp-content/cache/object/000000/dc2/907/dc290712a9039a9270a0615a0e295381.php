Â Former ALOUD participant and author Francisco Goldman calls the work, â€œBeguiling, and even crazily enchantingâ€¦gives us words for what we havenâ€™t had words for before.â€

In todayâ€™s Mexico, truth tellers are murdered, journalists are disappeared. As a novelist, poet, human rights activist, and former President of PEN Mexico, Clement lives ever-so-close to that world, and decided to turn to fiction to tell this story, one that remains hauntingly close to real life, in her latest work,Â <em>Prayers for the Stolen.</em>

This visceral novel sheds light on the fate of young women in rural Guerrero who live in the shadows of the drug war. In the words of Clement, â€œ<em>Prayers for the Stolen</em>Â is a novel about Ladydi Garcia MartÃ­nez. She is part of a community, like so many in rural Mexico, that has been decimated by drug traffickers, government agricultural policies and illegal immigration. Her home is a village near the once glamorous port of Acapulco. Her story, although inspired by truth, is fiction.â€
