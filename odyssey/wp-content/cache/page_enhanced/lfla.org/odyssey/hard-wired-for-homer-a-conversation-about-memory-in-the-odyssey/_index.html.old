Odyssey Project</em></h5><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Rebecca Rickman:  Reading <em>The Odyssey</em> through the lens of a neuroscientist who studies the relationship between emotional memory and trauma, what is it about the story that draws your attention?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Daniela Schiller:</strong> The first thing I noticed was the use of memory to express the difference between nostalgia and death. Nostalgia is a state of longing for the past that can be used to avoid the present. In <em>The Odyssey</em> the dead are stuck in the past with their memories fragmented and disconnected from their former context.  It is as if they are prisoners of their own memories.</p><p style="text-align: left;">In the poem, memory is used not only as a literary device for moving back and forth in time, quickening or slowing the narrative, but also to demonstrate movement or non-movement in the story.</p><p style="text-align: left;">What we understand from this is that memory needs a narrative; without a narrative, there is no journey. So in Odysseus’s nostalgia you have a narrative, but when you’re dead, the narrative is broken.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR:  This sounds like a description of people living with Alzheimer’s disease. They lose their memories and with this, their forward narrative momentum.</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS:</strong>  Yes. This is also similar to other mental disorders such as traumatic memories and phobias. Of course living in a constant state of nostalgia, which has a limited narrative, can also become a sort of pathology (like a broken record that always goes back to the same point).</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR:  This brings up the interesting question of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Do you see any demonstration of that trauma of memory in Odysseus’ behavior?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS:</strong> I am a neuroscientist rather than a clinical psychiatrist so I hesitate to comment on this.  But let’s just say that if, when Odysseus finally comes home, he wakes up at night with flashbacks, then this might be symptomatic of PTSD. Perhaps the re-telling of his journey is his healing process, his way of coming to terms with the past.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR:  I’m very interested by this idea of storytelling as a therapeutic device. Since the ancient Greeks there has been a distinguished body of literature created from the firsthand experience of war.  Today we have contemporary writers such as Karl Marlantes (<em>Matterhorn)</em>, Anthony Swofford (<em>Jarhead</em>), Kevin Powers and Phil Klay. These soldiers, returning from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, felt compelled to tell their stories and bear witness to the experience of warfare.  Perhaps this is art as a form of expiation?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS:</strong> I think what makes this storytelling so therapeutic is the act of sharing. It’s important to write it down and to process it. But I believe the most meaningful stage is communicating it to others, transforming a negative experience into something positive. The problem with many Veterans and people with trauma is that they cannot share their memories for fear of the gap between their experience and our understanding.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Odysseus is a very powerful and persuasive storyteller. In Homer’s time, epics were sung and singing is a way to fuse a memory with its emotional content.  If I had an accident, you might empathize, but if I created a powerful story or song out of it, you would feel it. Giving a story an aesthetic dimension is a very powerful way to share a memory and Homer is a supreme example of this.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR:  <em>The Odyssey</em> is filled with imagistic language which I assume functions as a way of fixing the information in memory for the storyteller as well as for the audience.  </strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS:</strong> Epics were transmitted orally and in this extemporaneous tradition, these bards appear to have selected words for their most attention-grabbing, significant, visually evocative and memorable qualities. If the language had been boring, I don’t think these poems would have endured long enough to be written down by Homer. These early storytellers either understood this intuitively, or they learned from their audiences and the language made an evolutionary adaptation over time in order to survive.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR:  Could we discuss the relationship between memory and identify?  Odysseus is a man who changes his identity throughout the poem, even calling himself ‘no-one’ to save his life.  So who is he really?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS:</strong> Odysseus himself keeps reminiscing and he returns to the past because it defines who he is, in the absence of home and consistency. But as with the bards retelling and modifying <em>The Odyssey</em>, he is also affected by the fragility of memory and its modification each time he retrieves it. With his companions dead, there is no one left to verify or refute Odysseus’s narrative. He is the sole carrier of these memories and therefore unbound by facts. When he comes home, it is the shared memories that validate his identity. Memory is like an identity card, you need it to identify yourself and for others to recognize you in the absence of other identifiers.</p><p style="text-align: left;">When he finally returns home, Odysseus is tested through his semantic (factual) memory, his procedural memory (his skill using the bow) and his spatial memory (such as the location of his marital bed). Spatial memory is actually one of our strongest skills; if you remember a room or a scene, it is highly complex information. When you want to aid memory it is helpful to put it in a spatial context to visualize it.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR: Like the memory palaces developed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to organize and recall information.</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS. </strong>Exactly.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>RR: Why do you think <em>The Odyssey</em> has endured in our collective memory and provided source material for other artists and writers over the last 2,500 years?</strong></p><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>DS: </strong>I think it is so intricately layered that everybody can see something in it. You can read it through the lens of memory, or you can read it through a historical lens or character build-up. It is also a story about identity or struggle and endurance. It has all the fundamental qualities that define what it means to live and to be human. And finally, we remember it because of the gorgeously vivid and evocative language that is used to tell the story.</p><p style="text-align: left;">My only regret is that we don’t have an opportunity see how Penelope and Odysseus resume their life together. After a twenty year absence, do they really share the same memories of their past together or has their memory changed? We are left with the assumption they do, but we never see them reminisce on specific events and agree on the details or the narrative. It is very likely that their retelling of their past during the last two decades has modified the way each of them remembers it.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps we need to use memory more as an “optional explanation” of events with the understanding that stories continue to change with each retelling.</p><hr /><p style="text-align: left;"><h5>*Daniela Schiller directs the Schiller Laboratory of Affective Neuroscience at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
