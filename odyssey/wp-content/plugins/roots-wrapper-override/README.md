# Roots Wrapper Override
A WordPress plugin that allows you to override the Roots wrapper templates from the WordPress dashboard. Supports the base and sidebar templates by default, with additional overrides only an array away (see **Extending**).

Requires the [Roots](http://www.roots.io) theme and wrapper to function. 

Fully supported in `6.5.0` or higher. Support for `6.4.0` can easily be added by updating the `Roots_Wrapping` class.

## Installation
Unzip and place into the `plugins` directory of your Roots based theme and activate. 

When using `6.4.0` please ensure the `Roots_Wrapping` class and helper functions (found in `lib/utils.php` or `lib/wrapper.php`) matches the class in **FAQ.md**.

## Usage
The templates available to select are shown in a meta box drop down list. Simply select the desired template and update to save. The template is saved as custom meta and, as its name suggests, will override the template selected by the `Roots_Wrapping` class.

To deselect a template, set to `(no override)` and save or remove the template file. 

### Naming Templates
Template filenames must begin with the same prefix as the default template i.e. all `base` templates must begin `base-` and all `sidebar` templates `sidebar-`. If you want to give your templates nice names, please see **FAQ.md**.

## Extending
Please see **FAQ.md** for how you can extend this plugin.

## Uninstallation
Deactivate the plugin to disable the overrides. Presently, the custom meta fields, `_roots_rwo_$prefix`, are not deleted with deactivation. This will assist with troubleshooting and prevent resetting the custom templates upon accidental deactivation.
